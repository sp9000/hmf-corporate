## Understanding the Data
SEO metrics in Google Analytics can help you track the performance of your website and measure the success of your SEO efforts. By monitoring engagement rate, measurements, landing pages, email sign-ups, retargeting and remarketing activities, you can gain valuable insights about how users interact with your website.

Engagement rate is an important metric that helps you understand how well people are engaging with your content. You can use it to track how much time they spend on each page of your website or blog post. Measurements like bounce rate and average session duration also provide valuable information about user engagement and reveal areas where improvements are needed.

Landing pages are another important SEO metric to monitor in Google Analytics. You can track which pages users land on when they enter your website and analyze which ones have the highest conversion rates. Additionally, tracking email sign-ups will give you an idea of how effective your lead generation campaigns are performing.
