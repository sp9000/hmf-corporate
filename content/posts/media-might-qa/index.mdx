Whether you're looking for a good laugh or an interesting story, these Florida-based podcasts have something for everyone. 

We decided to sit down for a meme with these two internet veterans.

### What is the name of the new podcast company?
Media Might. We dare to be auspiciously great, will settle for next best.

### What kind of content will the podcast company be focusing on?
Edutainment with a focus on the classics. Sort of modernizing the subject matter to make it easily digestable and funny.

### How have two young guns been able to turn the industry on its head?
Simply put, we decided to start with a showstring budget and go from there. Our hope is to inspire others to put themselves out there, because everyone has a unique perspective on the world that many people can relate to.

### What are some of the innovative features that this podcast company will offer?
We've been experimenting with 3D sets, fully equipped with cinematic lighting and authentic, life-like textures that are completely generated by computers.

### How has this new podcast company been able to generate so much buzz?
Honestly, it's been nearly impossible to keep the lid on this bad boy. We're humbled by the intrigue and anticipated a great response to our premier later this year.

### When can we expect this new podcast company to launch?
Launch is expected in the third quarter 2023, if not sooner.

### What sets this new podcast company apart from other existing companies in the industry?
Our staff are the hardest working people in the industry. I'm still awestruck with the ease in which they're envisaging our content. Not a dull day at work with so many exciting projects coming down the pipeline.
